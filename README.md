## Usage

I'm using VSCode to learning about Dart, for that add some extensions like:
[.run](https://github.com/formulahendry/vscode-code-runner)
[Dart](https://github.com/Dart-Code/Dart-Code)

The .run command is able to you run in the output of VSCode the code you're written in that moment, after you save it! (I always forgget about this, this is may be common, I think.)

So to run any code of this repository, open the specifically file and on your keyboard, hit the keys:
```
Ctrl + Alt + N
```
